Here are three detailed video prompts designed to feel "homemade" and authentic. They follow your specific 6-Part Viral Video Strategy.

The goal is to make the viewer feel like they are watching a genuine moment, not an ad.

### Option 1: The "Competitive Couple" (Relatable & Social)

**Vibe:** Sunday morning, messy hair, coffee on the table, handheld camera.
**POV:** Third-person (friend filming) or set up on a mug.

* **0-8s: The Hook (The Satisfying Sort)**
* **Visual:** Close-up of a phone screen on a table. Two hands (one male, one female) are hovering over it. The female finger quickly taps four items. They turn green immediately.
* **Audio:** Natural sound.
* **Dialogue:** (Her) "Boom. Too easy." (Him) "Wait, how did you see that?"


* **8-16s: The Challenge (Speed Run/Crossword)**
* **Visual:** Cut to them sitting on a couch. The phone is between them. They are frantically tapping answers into the Mini Crossword.
* **Dialogue:** (Overlapping) "Capital! No, wait, Paris!" "Okay, next, next!"


* **16-24s: The Logic (IQ Flex)**
* **Visual:** Sudden silence. Extreme close-up on the guy’s face, furrowed brow, looking intense. He is solving the Logic/Tango section. He hesitates, then taps.
* **Audio:** Clock ticking sound effect (subtle).
* **Action:** He taps the final square.


* **24-32s: The Flow (Word Ladder)**
* **Visual:** Over-the-shoulder shot. The screen shows the Word Ladder. The words are transforming rapidly as they type.
* **Dialogue:** (Her) "Change 'S' to 'P'... yes! Keep going."


* **32-40s: The Payoff (Dopamine Hit)**
* **Visual:** The "Level Up/Victory" screen flashes gold/confetti.
* **Action:** They high-five or the guy throws a pillow in victory.
* **Dialogue:** "New high score! Let's go!"


* **40-48s: The CTA (Invitation)**
* **Visual:** She looks at the camera (breaking the fourth wall) holding the phone.
* **Dialogue:** "Okay, try to beat 45 seconds. Link is in the bio."

### Option 2: The "Bored at Work" (Secret & Naughty)

**Vibe:** Office setting (or home office), whispering, hiding the screen, "us vs. the boss."
**POV:** First-person (POV) holding the phone under a desk or behind a laptop.

* **0-8s: The Hook (The Satisfying Sort)**
* **Visual:** POV looking down at a lap under a desk. Thumb swipes the "Connections" game. The groups sort perfectly into colors.
* **Overlay Text:** "Me ignoring my emails."


* **8-16s: The Challenge (Speed Run/Crossword)**
* **Visual:** Camera shakes slightly as someone walks by. The player types the Crossword answers incredibly fast with just one thumb.
* **Audio:** Office ambience (typing, phones ringing) + heavy breathing (nervous).


* **16-24s: The Logic (IQ Flex)**
* **Visual:** Cut to the player’s face reflection in the dark phone screen (or monitor). They look confused, then eyes widen as they solve the Logic puzzle.
* **Audio:** Internal monologue voiceover: *"If red is here... then blue must be... gotcha."*


* **24-32s: The Flow (Word Ladder)**
* **Visual:** The Word Ladder is flowing smoothly. The rhythm of typing matches the background sound of a printer or copier.
* **Audio:** Satisfying keyboard *clack* sounds added in post.


* **32-40s: The Payoff (Dopamine Hit)**
* **Visual:** Screen flashes "100% Complete." The player does a silent fist pump and covers their mouth to stop a scream.
* **Dialogue:** (Whispered) "Yes!"


* **40-48s: The CTA (Invitation)**
* **Visual:** The player quickly tilts the phone screen toward the camera lens.
* **Overlay Text:** "Don't get fired. Link in bio."

### Option 3: The "Genius POV" (ASMR & Satisfying)

**Vibe:** No faces, just hands and the screen. High contrast, focus on the sounds and the intelligence/speed.
**POV:** Top-down shot on a clean desk or bed sheets.

* **0-8s: The Hook (The Satisfying Sort)**
* **Visual:** A finger taps 4 items rhythmically: *Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.* They instantly merge.
* **Audio:** Synced to a beat or just raw, crisp tapping sounds (ASMR style).


* **8-16s: The Challenge (Speed Run/Crossword)**
* **Visual:** Time-lapse (sped up) of the Crossword being filled in. It looks like the letters are flowing like water.


* **16-24s: The Logic (IQ Flex)**
* **Visual:** Real-time speed again. The player solves the Logic puzzle without making a single mistake. It looks like a magic trick.
* **Overlay Text:** "Wait for the logic part..."


* **24-32s: The Flow (Word Ladder)**
* **Visual:** The Word Ladder transforms. The player creates a chain of words that rhyme.
* **Audio:** A rising musical scale sound effect with every correct word.


* **32-40s: The Payoff (Dopamine Hit)**
* **Visual:** The XP bar fills up all the way to the top. A "Daily Streak: 50" badge appears.
* **Audio:** A satisfying "Ding!"


* **40-48s: The CTA (Invitation)**
* **Visual:** The hand puts the phone down. A sticky note is placed next to it.
* **Handwritten on Note:** "Are you smarter than me? Link in bio."



### Production Tips for "Homemade" Feel:

* **Lighting:** Do not use ring lights. Use window light or regular room lamps.
* **Camera:** Do not use "Cinematic Mode." Standard video mode looks more authentic.
* **Imperfections:** If you stutter slightly or drop the phone, keep it in. It creates trust.

**Would you like me to adapt these scripts specifically for the "Superhero Movie" hub you mentioned previously, or keep them general?**
