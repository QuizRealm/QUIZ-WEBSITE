            <p><strong>1. Acceptance of Terms</strong><br>
            By accessing or using the QuizRealm website, games, or services (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>QuizRealm is a gamified educational platform providing trivia, logic puzzles, and personality assessments. The Service includes a progression system involving "XP" (Experience Points), levels, and virtual achievements. These virtual items have no real-world monetary value and cannot be exchanged for currency.</p>

            <h2>3. Anonymous Accounts & Data Persistence</h2>
            <p>QuizRealm utilizes a <strong>Hybrid Storage Model</strong>. We do not require traditional account registration (username/password). Instead, we assign a unique "Ghost ID" to your browser instance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Cache:</strong> Your immediate progress is stored on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Sync:</strong> Key milestones and legal telemetry data are synchronized to our cloud database to prevent data corruption.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk of Loss:</strong> Because accounts are anonymous, if you clear your browser cookies, use "Incognito/Private" mode, or switch devices, <strong>you will lose access to your account and progress.</strong> QuizRealm cannot recover lost anonymous accounts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
            <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes. You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use any automated system, including "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the QuizRealm servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period.</li>
                <li>Attempt to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security, or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service.</li>
                <li>Exploit bugs or glitches to artificially inflate your XP, Rank, or Leaderboard standing ("Stat Padding").</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>The Service and its original content (excluding third-party trivia facts), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of QuizRealm and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both domestic and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of QuizRealm.</p>
            <p>Trivia questions related to pop culture franchises (e.g., Marvel, Star Wars, Harry Potter) are used under principles of <strong>Fair Use</strong> for educational, transformative, and parody purposes. We claim no ownership over these external intellectual properties.</p>

            <h2>6. Third-Party Links and Ads</h2>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by QuizRealm. We may also display advertisements provided by third-party networks such as <strong>Google AdSense</strong>.</p>
            <p>QuizRealm has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that QuizRealm shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>

            <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
            <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. QUIZREALM MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THEIR SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, OR MATERIALS INCLUDED THEREIN. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THESE SERVICES, THEIR CONTENT, AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED FROM US IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL QUIZREALM, ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR AFFILIATES, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE; AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>

            <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>

            <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
