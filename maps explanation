Here are the five premium, high-detail world maps you requested. They are all perfectly uniform in style, size, and color palette, visualizing different global datasets with a photorealistic nighttime view.

1. Cities (Gold Lights)
This map shows the density of human population and urban development. The golden lights are brightest and most concentrated in major cities and metropolitan areas.





2. Seaports (Blue Lights)
This map visualizes all global seaports. The blue points of light precisely trace the world's coastlines, with higher concentrations in major shipping hubs.





3. Railroads (Green Lines)
This map shows the world's railway networks. The glowing green lines form a dense web in highly connected continents like Europe and Asia, while long, singular lines traverse vast areas like Siberia.





4. Roads (Pink Lines)
This map illustrates the global road network. The glowing pink lines create the most extensive and dense web of all the maps, covering most inhabited areas on Earth.





5. Airports (Red Dots)
This map displays all global airport locations. The red beacons of light are scattered across the continents, forming dense constellations in regions with high air traffic.
